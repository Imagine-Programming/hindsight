# hindsight
Hindsight is not a fully featured debugger that can be used for advanced debugging of software in development phase. Hindsight is a portable debugger that can be run by the end-user to generate a report on some of the behaviour of the program being debugged. The most notable events this debugger is interested in, are breakpoints and exceptions.
